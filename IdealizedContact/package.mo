<p>To describe elementary <a href=\"modelica://IdealizedContact.ContactSurfaces\">contact surfaces</a>, the library provides ready-to-use blocks. The surface definition represents a thin and massless layer, which can be connected to any kind of rigid body by a frame connector. The dimensions of the surface can be parameterized. In order to be able to use the dimensions in the contact block we introduce a new interface to connect the surface definition with a contact block. The figure shows the resulting shape of the contact area for all possible combinations that are analytically solved, as well as the number of contact points to describe it.</p>
<p><br><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/table_contactsurfaces.png\"/></p>
<p>Furthermore, the library offers the possibility to calculate contact points on convex surfaces using iterative Newton algorithm. These surfaces are described in a parametric form. Currently, the following <a href=\"modelica://IdealizedContact.ContactSurfaces.ParametricSurfaceDefinition\">parametric surfaces</a> are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>spherical</li>
<li>ellipsoid</li>
<li>cylindrical</li>
<li>egg</li>
</ul>
<p><br>They can either collide with one another or with planar contact surfaces.</p>

<p>The library includes predefined, <a href=\"modelica://IdealizedContact.ElementaryContactBodies\">elementary bodies</a> like cuboids or cylinders which combine several contact surfaces and include a Multibody block. Each contact surface can be enabled separately. These do contain masses and moments of inertia, which are calculated by the dimensions and the density of the material. The Figure displays the<b> ElementaryContactBodies</b> that are currently available.</p>

<p>The <a href=\"modelica://IdealizedContact.ContactBlock.Contact\">contact block</a> calculates the appropriate force depending on the combination of surfaces. It is connected to a corresponding pair of contact surfaces. So, the respective combination of contact surfaces has to be chosen at first by setting the parameter contactDefinition. This will use the Modelica replaceable statement to define the appropriate components of the contact block. Then connect the contact interfaces of the two contact surfaces to the respective port of the contact block (first&nbsp;surface&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;must&nbsp;be&nbsp;connected&nbsp;to&nbsp;port&nbsp;1).</p>
<p>In the case of a collision of the two connected surface (the contact condition holds for at least one contact point) a three-dimensional contact force is applied. It consists of both the normal force and the tangential friction. The respective directions can be obtained by means of the local coordinate systems in the contact points. As compared to more complex models, the continuous surface layer is replaced by a nonlinear spring/damper element. Consequently, the normal force Fn&nbsp;is determined by means of the penetration p&nbsp;and the penetration velocity. A continuous contact force model with hysteresis damping according to [9] is implemented. Nevertheless, choosing n1=1 and n=0&nbsp;one can get the linear Kelvin-Voigt model, where the coefficients are the spring and damping constant. Choosing n1=n2&nbsp;one will get the formulation according to [10].</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/equations/Fn.jpg\"/></p>
<p><br/>In order to calculate the friction forces without further discontinuous events, which would decrease the simulation speed and impede controller design, we use the continuously differentiable friction model of Makkar et al. [11]. They introduced the following function of the relative velocity&nbsp;to approximate the friction coefficient&nbsp;of the characteristic Stribeck curve.</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/equations/mue.jpg\"/></p>
<p>In doing so, no ideal static friction can be obtained because the actual force to be applied in the static state is independent from the relative velocity&nbsp;of the two bodies. Static friction is rather represented by sliding with very small relative velocities. To set the unknown constants gamma_i we use five parameters, which can be seen in the figure. The parameters mue_s&nbsp;and mue_k&nbsp;denote the coefficients of static and kinetic friction. The limit velocity v_e1&nbsp;and v_e2&nbsp;define the beginning of mixed and viscous friction. The latter is described by the proportionality factor k_v.</p>
<p><br/><br/><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/mue.jpg\"/></p>
<p><br/>The complete vector of the contact force is then computed as follows.</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/equations/Fcontact.jpg\"/></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The collision of two cylinders can lead to linear or punctiform contact regions. The calculation for these two cases is currently separated in two blocks. Integration of the two blocks is in progress.</p>

<p>In order to be able to use the dimensions of the contact surfaces in the contact block a new <a href=\"modelica://IdealizedContact.Interfaces\">interface</a> to connect the surface definition with a contact block  is introduced. This adds a scalar vector to the MultiBody frame of the Modelica Standard Library that comprises maximum three terms to describe the surface geometry and the three direction vectors to resolve them in the connected frame. The latter constitutes the body coordinate system (BCS) of the contact surface.</p>

<p><b>What are the main
differences to the previous version of the Modelica License?</b></p>
<ol>
  <li><p>
  Modelica License 1 is unclear whether the licensed Modelica package
  can be distributed under a different license. Version 2 explicitly
  allows that &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; can be distributed under
  any license of Your choice, see examples in Section 1d) as to what
  qualifies as Derivative Work (so, version 2 is clearer).</p>
  <li><p>
  If You modify a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (besides
  fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations, using
  a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, or using another
  representation, e.g., a binary representation), you must rename the
  root-level name of the package for your distribution. In version 1
  you could keep the name (so, version 2 is more restrictive). The
  reason of this restriction is to reduce the risk that Modelica
  packages are available that have identical names, but different
  functionality.</p>
  <li><p>
  Modelica License 1 states that &ldquo;It is not allowed to charge a
  fee for the original version or a modified version of the software,
  besides a reasonable fee for distribution and support&rdquo;.
  Version 2 has a similar intention for all Original Work under
  <u>Modelica License 2</u> (to remain free of charge and open source)
  but states this more clearly as &ldquo;No fee, neither as a
  copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for the copy as such may
  be charged&rdquo;. Contrary to version 1, Modelica License 2 has no
  restrictions on fees for Derivative Work that is provided under a
  different license (so, version 2 is clearer and has fewer
  restrictions).</p>
  <li><p>
  Modelica License 2 introduces several useful provisions for the
  licensee (articles 5, 6, 12), and for the licensor (articles 7, 12,
  13, 14) that have no counter part in version 1.</p>
  <li><p>
  Modelica License 2 can be applied to all type of work, including
  documents, images and data files, contrary to version 1 that was
  dedicated for software only (so, version 2 is more general).</p>
</ol>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) as part of my commercial
Modelica modeling and simulation environment?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to Section 2c). However, you are not allowed to charge a
fee for this part of your environment. Of course, you can charge for
your part of the environment.
</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different
license?</b></p>
<p>No.
The license of an unmodified Modelica package cannot be changed
according to Sections 2c) and 2d). This means that you cannot <u>sell</u>
copies of it, any distribution has to be free of charge.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first encrypt the package?</b></p>
<p>No.
Merely encrypting a package does not qualify for Derivative Work and
therefore the encrypted package has to stay under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first add classes to the package?</b></p>
<p>No.
The package itself remains unmodified, i.e., it is Original Work, and
therefore the license for this part must remain under Modelica
License 2. The newly added classes can be, however, under a different
license.
</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it </b><u><b>unmodified</b></u><b> in a Modelica package
under a </b><u><b>commercial/proprietary license</b></u><b>?</b></p>
<p>No,
according to article 2c). However, you can include model, block,
function, package, record and connector classes in your Modelica
package under <u>Modelica License 2</u>. This means that your
Modelica package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but
one or more classes of it are under Modelica License 2.<br>Note, a
&ldquo;type&rdquo; class (e.g., type Angle = Real(unit=&rdquo;rad&rdquo;))
can be copied and included unmodified under a commercial/proprietary
license (for details, see the next question).</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a type class or </b><u><b>part</b></u><b> of a model, block,
function, record, connector class, out of a Modelica package (under
Modelica License 2) and include it modified or unmodified in a
Modelica package under a </b><u><b>commercial/proprietary</b></u><b>
license</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this will in the end usually qualify
as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: A type class or
part of another class (e.g., an equation, a declaration, part of a
class description) cannot be utilized &ldquo;by its own&rdquo;. In
order to make this &ldquo;usable&rdquo;, you have to add additional
code in order that the class can be utilized. This is therefore
usually Derivative Work and Derivative Work can be provided under a
different license. Note, this only holds, if the additional code
introduced is sufficient to qualify for Derivative Work. Merely, just
copying a class and changing, say, one character in the documentation
of this class would be no Derivative Work and therefore the copied
code would have to stay under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it in </b><u><b>modified </b></u><b>form in a
</b><u><b>commercial/proprietary</b></u><b> Modelica package?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
If the modification can be seen as a &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;,
you can place it under your commercial/proprietary license. If the
modification does not qualify as &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; (e.g.,
bug fixes, vendor specific annotations), it must remain under
Modelica License 2. This means that your Modelica package could be
under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more parts of it
are under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
&ldquo;save total model&rdquo; under my commercial/proprietary
license, even if classes under Modelica License 2 are included?</b></p>
<p>Your
classes of the &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; can be distributed
under your commercial/proprietary license, but the classes under
Modelica License 2 must remain under Modelica License 2. This means
you can distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo;, but some parts
might be under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) in encrypted form?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
Note, if the encryption does not allow &ldquo;copying&rdquo; of
classes (in to unencrypted Modelica source code), you have to send
the Modelica source code of this package to your customer, if he/she
wishes it, according to article&nbsp;6.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute an
executable under my commercial/proprietary license, if the model from
which the executable is generated uses models from a Modelica package
under Modelica License 2?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this is seen as Derivative Work. The
reasoning is the following: An executable allows the simulation of a
concrete model, whereas models from a Modelica package (without
pre-processing, translation, tool run-time library) are not able to
be simulated without tool support. By the processing of the tool and
by its run-time libraries, significant new functionality is added (a
model can be simulated whereas previously it could not be simulated)
and functionality available in the package is removed (e.g., to build
up a new model by dragging components of the package is no longer
possible with the executable).</p>

<p><b>Is my modification to
a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) a Derivative Work?</b></p>
<p>It
is not possible to give a general answer to it. To be regarded as &quot;an
original work of authorship&quot;, a derivative work must be
different enough from the original or must contain a substantial
amount of new material. Making minor changes or additions of little
substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new
version for such purposes.
</p>

<h6>Using or Distributing a Modelica <u>Document</u> under the Modelica License 2</h6>

<p>This
section is devoted especially for the following applications:</p>
<ol type=\"a\">
  <li><p>
  A Modelica tool extracts information out of a Modelica package and
  presents the result in form of a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; for this
  package in, e.g., html, doc, or pdf format.</p>
  <li><p>
  The Modelica language specification is a document defining the
  Modelica language. It will be licensed under Modelica License 2.</p>
  <li><p>
  Someone writes a book about the Modelica language and/or Modelica
  packages and uses information which is available in the Modelica
  language specification and/or the corresponding Modelica package.</p>
</ol>

<p><b>Can I sell a manual
that was basically derived by extracting information automatically
from a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (e.g., a &ldquo;reference
guide&rdquo; of the Modelica Standard Library):</b></p>
<p>Yes.
Extracting information from a Modelica package, and providing it in a
human readable, suitable format, like html, doc or pdf format, where
the content is significantly modified (e.g. tables with interface
information are constructed from the declarations of the public
variables) qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no restrictions
to charge a fee for Derivative Work under alternative 2d).</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica
License 2) and use it </b><u><b>unmodified</b></u><b> in my document
(e.g. the Modelica syntax description in the Modelica Specification)?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
In case you distribute your document, the copied parts are still
under Modelica License 2 and you are not allowed to charge a license
fee for this part. You can, of course, charge a fee for the rest of
your document.</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica
License 2) and use it in </b><u><b>modified</b></u><b> form in my
document?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
the creation of Derivative Works is allowed. In case the content is
significantly modified this qualifies as Derivative Work and there
are no restrictions to charge a fee for Derivative Work under
alternative 2d).</p>

<p><b>Can I sell a printed
version of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2), e.g., the
Modelica Language Specification?</b></p>
<p>No,
if you are not the copyright-holder, since article 2c) does not allow
a selling fee for a (in this case physical) copy. However, mere
printing and shipping costs may be recovered.</p>

<p>The<b> Idealized Contact</b> Library is a free Modelica package for modeling and handling of collisions in MultiBody Systems.</p>
<p>Modeling of multibody mechanics plays a central role in the design of mechatronic systems. In technical use-cases, these often contain loose couplings, where contact is possible. The IdealizedContact library is ready-to-use contact library for Modelica. It comprises surface definitions for simple contact surfaces, which can be connected with the multibodies of the Modelica Standard Library. It furthermore implements a force-based approach between single contact points. The contact forces are calculated in configurable non-central contact blocks. </p>
<p>The aim is to bring the designer in the position to perform simulations of industrial applications including contacts. Thereby, the analysis of the principle functional capability of the system in the course of the conceptual design is focused. This entails specialized modeling principles concerning the usability and the interpretation of the simulation results, which both should be relatively easy. In addition, it should be possible to define each component separately in order to be able to reuse and combine approved patterns in new applications (c.f. [4]).</p>
<p>Detailed explenations of the concept can be found in the respective <a href=\"modelica://IdealizedContact.UsersGuide.Literature\">Literature</a>. Exemplarily the results of chosen experiments are shown therein. They are compared with benchmark simulations in RecurDyn. </p>

In order to be able to use them in the contact block we introduce a new interface to connect the surface definition with the contact block of this library. This adds a scalar vector to the MultiBody frame of the Modelica Standard Library. It comprises maximum three terms to describe the surface geometry and the three direction vectors to resolve them in the connected frame. The latter constitutes the body coordinate system of the contact surface. This model defines a spherical contact surface.</p>

<p>The surface definition represents a thin and massless layer, which can be connected to any kind of rigid body by a frame connector. The dimensions can be parameterized. In order to be able to use them in the contact block we introduce a new interface to connect the surface definition with the contact block of this library. This adds a scalar vector to the MultiBody frame of the Modelica Standard Library. It comprises maximum three terms to describe the surface geometry and the three direction vectors to resolve them in the connected frame. The latter constitutes the body coordinate system of the contact surface. This model can be used for any convex contact surface defined.</p>

        Documentation(info="<!DOCTYPE html><html>
<p>Depending on the shape, we use 1 (sphere), 2 (cylinder) or 4 (plane) points to describe the surfaces of the contact partners. These constitute potential contact points. For each of them the collision detection is performed. For this purpose, analytic solutions for simple geometries are provided in the library. As the contact region may alter with the moving bodies, the contact points will also move on the defined surface.</p>
<p>Then, the contact block calculates the appropriate force depending on the combination of surfaces. So, using it the respective combination of contact surface has to be chosen at first by setting the parameter contactDefinition. This will use the Modelica replaceable statement to define the appropriate components of the contact block. Then connect the contact interfaces of the two contact surfaces to the respective port of the contact block (first&nbsp;surface&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;must&nbsp;be&nbsp;connected&nbsp;to&nbsp;port&nbsp;1).</p>
<p>In the case of a collision of the two connected surface (the contact condition holds for at least one contact point) a three-dimensional contact force is applied. It consists of both the normal force and the tangential friction. The respective directions can be obtained by means of the local coordinate systems in the contact points. As compared to more complex models, the continuous surface layer is replaced by a nonlinear spring/damper element. Consequently, the normal force Fn&nbsp;is determined by means of the penetration p&nbsp;and the penetration velocity. A continuous contact force model with hysteresis damping according to [1] is implemented. Nevertheless, choosing n1=1 and n=0&nbsp;one can get the linear Kelvin-Voigt model, where the coefficients are the spring and damping constant. Choosing n1=n2&nbsp;one will get the formulation according to [2].</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/equations/Fn.jpg\"/></p>
<p><br/>In order to calculate the friction forces without further discontinuous events, which would decrease the simulation speed and impede controller design, we use the continuously differentiable friction model of Makkar et al. [3]. They introduced the following function of the relative velocity&nbsp;to approximate the friction coefficient&nbsp;of the characteristic Stribeck curve.</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/equations/mue.jpg\"/></p>
<p>In doing so, no ideal static friction can be obtained because the actual force to be applied in the static state is independent from the relative velocity&nbsp;of the two bodies. Static friction is rather represented by sliding with very small relative velocities. To set the unknown constants gamma_i we use five parameters, which can be seen in the figure. The parameters mue_s&nbsp;and mue_k&nbsp;denote the coefficients of static and kinetic friction. The limit velocity v_e1&nbsp;and v_e2&nbsp;define the beginning of mixed and viscous friction. The latter is described by the proportionality factor k_v. The actual approximation can be monitored by calling the function <a href=\"IdealizedContact.ContactBlock.plotFrictionCurve\">plotFrictionCurve</a>.</p>
<p><br/><br/><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/mue.jpg\"/></p>
<p><br/>The complete vector of the contact force is then computed as follows.</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/equations/Fcontact.jpg\"/></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The collision of two cylinders can lead to linear or punctiform contact regions. The calculation for these two cases is currently separated in two blocks. Integration of the two blocks is in progress.</p>

<p><img src=\"modelica://IdealizedContact/Resources/Images/equations/mue.jpg\"/></p>
<p>To set the unknown constants gamma_i we use five parameters, which can be seen in the figure. The parameters mue_s&nbsp;and mue_k&nbsp;denote the coefficients of static and kinetic friction. The limit velocity v_e1&nbsp;and v_e2&nbsp;define the beginning of mixed and viscous friction. The latter is described by the proportionality factor k_v. To display the current curve attune the inputs of the function.</p>
